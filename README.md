HeySeen is an application that turns PDF files—like scientific papers or specialized books—into folders containing editable TeX files and images, if there are any. This lets you work with the original text and formulas using LaTeX editors.

## 🔍 About HeySeen

When you get a PDF, it can be difficult to extract the structured content, especially for technical documents with formulas and images. HeySeen helps by converting these PDFs automatically into editable LaTeX source files. This process includes:

- Extracting text that is usually inside articles or books.
- Identifying and saving images separately.
- Creating TeX files that represent the document layout.
- Supporting scientific notation and complex formatting.

HeySeen relies on technologies like OCR (optical character recognition)—which reads the text from images—and LaTeX converters to rebuild the document. The tool uses Python and Pytorch frameworks with OCR engines like Tesseract and Surya OCR.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

To run HeySeen smoothly, your computer should meet these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.13+, or any recent Linux distribution.
- **Processor:** Dual-core 2 GHz or faster.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Storage:** Minimum 500 MB of free space to install and convert files.
- **Software:**  
  - Python 3.7 or newer (HeySeen includes all necessary files if using the prepackaged app).
